# TimesApp

## How I approached modularising the app ?
i have three types of module

1. “data” module.

    These typically contain a repository for accessing data remotely or via disk.

2. “presentation” module
   
    These contain the screens, view models,ui rendring , etc for a feature.  

3. “Domain” module
