## How I approached modularising the app ?

Separating core logic can help to create a clear separation of concerns that makes our code easier to understand so ,

i modularised the app to three types of layers

- ##  Data layer 

    This typically contain a repository for accessing data remotely or via disk.

- ## Presentation layer 

    Will include normal Activities and Fragments, which will only handle rendering views and will follow MVVM pattern

- ## Domain layer 

    Will include all business logic and interact between Data and Presentation layer by means of interface and interactors. The objective is to make the domain layer independent of anything, so the business logic can be tested without any dependency to external components


## Technical Notes:



* [x] MVVM UI approach 
* [x] Unit tests using Junit    
* [x] UI tests using espresso  


coverage reports can be generated by executing the following command in terminal `gradlew createDebugCoverageReport`
it will be generated at `app\build\reports\coverage\debug\index.html`
